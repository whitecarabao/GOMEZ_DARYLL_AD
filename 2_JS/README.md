Additional Exercises complied:

VariableTypes.js
MultiplicationTable.js
PrimeNumbers.js - ***PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS BELOW!***

**WARNING**
For PrimeNumbers.js, please run via:

```
node PrimeNumbers.js
```

*and not via the VS Code Debug Terminal*

For PrimeNumbers.js, input a number and press ENTER.

The other two JS apps are not interactive.

Readlines are not processed properly by the debug terminal for some reason, but will run fine in the terminal.

Additionally, console.log() will append a newline in the datastream, which will trigger readlines
and give developers the impression that their code has been skipped.

Time to get some zzz!
